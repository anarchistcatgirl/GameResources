# GameResources
Repo containing basic resources for games such as basic materials/textures, scripts, models, and UI elements. Although these are mainly for my own use, anybody can use the contents of this repository free of charge, I however require crediting this repo or myself if you use anything from it.

The contents of this repo are made up of pieces I made for personal and school projects, so some pieces may be very general or very specialized. I am by no means an artist, so any materials/texture or models are unlikely to be high quality.
